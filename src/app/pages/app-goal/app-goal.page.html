      <h1> My Goal</h1>
      <p>In this application, I am going to develop the university events & notifications where students can aware of all the events. 
        It helps the students if there is an online class so I also add the button known as LMS login where a student just clicks on 
        LMS and adds his id, and password to enter the class (provided by University). In this application, a notification button is 
        just to notify the studentâ€™s class or other activities, etc. Overall, this application very helps full for students.</p>
